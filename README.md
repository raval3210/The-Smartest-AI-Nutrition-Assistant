# The-Smartest-AI-Nutrition-Assistant

Key Features Implemented:

    Used Datasets: Uses the actual USDA FoodData Central dataset from HuggingFace

    State-of-the-Art Models: Implements BLIP-2 (more accurate than BLIP) and Flan-T5

    Robust Nutrition Analysis: food matching and nutritional calculations

    Interface:  Gradio UI with better organization

    Advanced Tracking: NutritionTracker class for comprehensive meal logging

How to Use:

    Run the notebook cells sequentially to set up the environment

    The Gradio interface will launch automatically with three main tabs:

        Food Analysis: Upload food images for identification and nutritional info

        Meal Plan Generator: Get personalized meal plans based on your profile

        Healthier Alternatives: Find better options for specific foods

I have used Google Colab for Implementation and Running the Project.
